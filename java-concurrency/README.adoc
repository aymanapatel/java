=== Working with Threads

Checklist for working with Threads

* [x] **Synchronization of Data** : Protecting object state and memory; NOT CODE
* [x] **Synchronization of coorperation between Threads** : Define a coorperative mechanism between Threads
* [x] **Acquiring Monitors**: Acquire monitor prevent other threads to access monitor. But it does not Protect the Object.
* [x] Unsynchronized methods can see (and modify) inconsistent state even if the object's monitor is locked.
* [x] Locking an `Object[]` does not lock individual objects
* [x] `synchronized` cannot appear on a method in interface (even for `default` method definition). https://stackoverflow.com/a/23463334/9642851[Why is it so? StackOverflow answer]
* [x] Inner classes are just syntactic sugar, so locks on inner classes have no effect on the enclosing class (and vice versa).
* [x] Javaâ€™s locks are reentrant. This means that if a thread holding a monitor encounters a synchronized block for the same monitor, it can enter the block.


== Basics

- Semaphore
- Mutex
- `volatile` and `synchronized` (And why to not use them)

== `CompletableFuture`, `ExecutorService` and `ForkJoin`

== Thread Pooling and Thread Syncing
