> Question in Discord: How do I synchronize threads? Java #concurrency Jan 18


== Types of Thread Pools

=== `FixedThreadPool`

> Pool with 1 thread

=== `CachedThreadPool`

> Pool creates as many threads 


=== `ScheduledThreadPool`



=== `SingleThreadedThreadPool`


== Approaches for Thread syncing

=== Approach 1: Use `java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch`



=== Approach 2: Use `java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService.invokeAll()`


=== Approach 3: Use `synchronized` and `volatle` primities

WARNING: For the LOVE OF GOD; **DON'T DO THIS**




=== Approach 4: Use `java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool`

=== Approach 5: Use Message Passing constructs instead of Concurrency

- Actor Model
- CSP (Communicationg Sequential Processes)
- SEDA (Staged Event Driven Architecture)

=== Approach 6: Use `java.util.concurrent.Exchanger`

=== Approach 7: Use `java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier`

NOTE: Approach 2 seems to be very clean and a good higher-level abstraction.
