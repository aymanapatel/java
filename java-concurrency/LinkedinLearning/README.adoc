== Introduction

=== Latency vs Throughput

.Latency vs Throughput
[options=header]
|===
| Throughput | Latency
| How many tasks can be handled simultaneously over a period of time | Measure of single task to take?
| Waiting thread = Slow performance | Waiting thread = Slow performance
|===

> Prolonged *latency* problems will lead to *throughput* problems

=== Parallelism vs Concurrency

.Parallelism vs Concurrency
[options=header]
|===
| Parallelism | Concurrency
| Different processor, multiple code execution | Same processor, multiple code execution

NOTE: Know your hardware


== Source of Blocked Threads

=== Synchronization and Locking

1. **Synchronization**: 
    - Forces 1-by-1 access to methods and data (resources)
    - Prevents data access corruption.

2. Locking
    - A tool used to enforce syncronization.
    
Threads MUST acquire lock to a particular object prior to accessing that object    
     

.Synchronized and Unsynchronized classes in Java
[options=header]
|===

| Synchronized | Unsynchronized
| `Vector` | `ArrayList`
| `StringBuffer` | `StringBuilder`
|===

[red]#Syncronization = Thread-safe.#
[green]#BUT, this also means it has performance-issues.#

=== Why people say Synchronized is not a great solution

- Even though it is thread-safe, but it impacts performance in a muti-threaded environment.
- Use design patterns to avoid synchronization.


== Garbege Collection 


=== JVM Garbage Collector Algorithm

- Concurrent Mark Sweep GC (CMS-GC) - Old, Pre JDK 9. It is deprecated
- G1 GC - JDK 9 Later
- Z GC - OpendJDK11 and later

=== Tuning JVM GCs

- GC are sometimes selfish 
- Stop the world
- How much heap space can be reclaimed

NOTE: todo Read Gaurav and other GC videos to get into algos


== Resource Pooling

In the real world, we cannot descrease latency or increase throughput by throwing more stuff at it to make it faster. Sometimes, just need to deal with the fact that we need to fix either throughtput or latency issues but doing both together is next to possible.

It is better to server smaller users faster (lower latency : with small throughput) than serve high # of users longer (hih throughput but lower latency).

Solutions:

1. Make Componenets available immediately for use.
2. Reduce amount of time spent `wait()` for threads
3. Efficient use of black-box (unknown) systems and resources.
4. Predicatable forecasting of an application's capacity.

As per the code:

1. Lowerinefficient SQL queries
2. Lower inefficient Hibernate or JPA code 
3. Optimize network optimizations


=== Reactive Programming

> Improves throughput 

1. Message oriented
2. Easily parallelize
3. Eficient use of threads. Allows different threads to finish one task.
        Meaning: 
        
        |-------Thread1(t1)------|    |-------Thread2--(t1 freed)----|
        Connection to external    --> Do Business Logic
        

== Tools

=== Java Microbenchmark Harness (JMH) (OpenJDK12)

> Provides hyper-localized testing of code to get performance metrics (`@Benchmark`)


== Change some defaults


=== Change GC defaults

JVM in JDK 8 reserves only 25%. This is fine for local environment. But for higher environments, we need to configure to increase JVM heap size so that excessive GC does not happen frequently

Heap size can be configured as given below:

```
-XX:InitialRAMPercentage
-XX:MaxRAMPercentage
-XX:MinRAMPercentage
```


=== Async Pooling

Use `AsyncAppender` in logback. Search for `Async` appenders in Log4J.

=== DB Pooling

There are many JDBC connection pool, but https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP[HikariCP] is by far the best and should be used by default.


== Java Stream Issues

Features:

1. Immutable
2. Lazily evaluated
3. Support cheap parallelism
4. Fluent API with Lambda expressions


=== `parallelStream()`


If you run this on a virtualized/containerized environement, it may not give performance benefit. 

- **DO NOT PARALLELIZE SMALL UNITS OF WORK**
- **DO NOT PARALLELIZE INFINITE STREAMS OF DATA**


> Rule of thumb: Add parallelism only if they are Observable improvement benefits.


=== Major Stream Issue: Do not give custom thread support in Stream API

Example:

```
public static List<String> pocWithParallelStream(List<String> inputString) {

    return inputString.parallelStream()
            .map(Scrambler::scrambleWithName)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
}


public static synchronized List<String> pocWithParallelStreamSynchronized(List<String> inputString) {

    return inputString.parallelStream()
            .map(Scrambler::scrambleWithName)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
}
// pocWithParallelStream and pocWithParallelStreamSynchronized will use the same thread pool which results in starving your entire application
```

== Troubleshoot Blocked Threads


=== Tools

==== Reactive Tool (Look after $hit happens)

1. `jcmd`
2. `jstat`
3. `jstack`
4. JFR: Can be proactive as well

==== Proactive Tool (Look after $hit happens)

1. Pinpoint (OSS APM)
2. Datadog
3. Prometheous
4. Dynatrace
5. New Relic
6. Java: `jvisualvm`
7. `JMC` (Java Mission Control)

=== Static Code analyzer

1. PMD (Multi-language; IDE support; Worked only with `.java` files)
2. FindBugs (Only Java; can work with both `.java` and `.class`)



== Thread Dumps

1. JMC
2. JFR
3. `jvisualvm`
4. jcmd
4. jstack




Steps

1. **Find your Java Process ID**
    - Windows: `tasklist /fi "imagename eq java.exe"`
    - Unix/Mac: `pgrep java`
    
2. Thread dump suing `jcmd`: `jcmd <PID> Thread.print > thread_dump.txt `



=== Thread Dump Analyzer
   
1. `jstack.review`
2. Spotify Thread Dump Analyzer
